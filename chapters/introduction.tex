\section{Introduction}

Kafka is a high throughput distributed messaging system. Unlike other messaging systems, Kafka is tailored for high throughput situations, where vast amounts of data need to be moved in a scalable, fault-tolerant way. Kafka was created by LinkedIn in 2010 to solve scalability issues with their usage tracking and news feeds. The name Kafka itself comes from the German language writer Franz Kafka. Kaf-ka-esque describes a nightmarish situation which most people can somehow relate to. Such was the state of LinkedIn's infrastructure prior to Kafka's conception.

\subsection{Goals of Kafka}

LinkedIn set some goals for their next generation messaging system. In order for it to be a viable tool it had to fulfil the following.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Had to handle huge amounts of data running into the terra-bytes and beyond
  \item Had to scale horizontally, making it easy to add extra machines on demand
  \item The system had to be lossless and reliable, as well as fault tolerant and recoverable
\end{itemize}

\section{Part 2 Genetic Algorithms}

\subsection{Introduction}

Genetic algorithms are a family of optimization algorithms based on the idea of natural selection. During natural selection an environment is prepared with a population of individuals, where each individual competes for their right to survive and reproduce. Some of the advantages of genetic algorithms are outlined below

\begin{itemize}
  \item It is less computationally expensive than brute forcing results
  \item Due to the random nature of the mutations, you are likely to get a wide range of results for a given solution
  \item The concept is realtively easy to understand
  \item Requires less information about the problem you are trying to solve
\end{itemize}

Some of the dissadvantages are

\begin{itemize}
  \item You are not always guaranteed to get the optimal result
  \item It can be hard to select the correct methods of selection, crossover and mutation
\end{itemize}

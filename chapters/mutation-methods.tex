\section{Mutation Methods}

\subsection{Scramble Mutation}

In scramble mutation, two gene indexes are selected at random. A slice of the genes is created between the 2 indexes. The new slice is then randomly shuffled and is re-inserted back into the original genes between the same indexes. This process is outlined in the image below.

\subsection{Reciprocal Exchange Mutation}

This is a very simple mutation method. 2 Genes are selected at random and then swapped with each other.

In the image above, 2 and 5 are selected at random and then swapped in the resulting chromosome.

\section{Mutation Methods}

\subsection{Scramble Mutation}

In scramble mutation two gene indexes are selected at random. A slice of the genes is created between the 2 indexes. The new slice is then randomly shuffled and is re-inserted back into the original genes between the same indexes. This process is outlined in the image below.

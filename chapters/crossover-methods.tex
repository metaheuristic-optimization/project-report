\section{Crossover Methods}

\subsection{Uniform crossover}

This crossover method selects random indexes of both parents that will be copied over to the children in the same position that they appeared. Then, remaining genes will be copied from parent 1 to child 2 in the order of their appearence, skipping over the ones already present in the child. The same will apply for parent 2 and child 1.
